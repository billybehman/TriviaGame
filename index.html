<!-- //1) Create a start button that loads the questions page when clicked
// 1) start at timer when the questions page loads
// 2) have four buttons for each questions div. The button that is pressed visually reacts, if another button is pressed then the previous button unreacts
// 3) make it so that when the timer hits 0, the computer reads the answers chosen and compares that with the correct answers. it also has to recognize which questions are unanswered. 
// 4) the computer must then bring you to a new screen that shows you your correct answeres, incorrect answeres, and your questions unsanswered -->


<!-- create an array of correct answers. match the arraw of answers chosen to the array of correct ones?
if a button is clicked, then the button will = clicked, if another button is clicked, then that button will = unclicked, and the new button will = clicked
when the timer's up or when they click, finished, the computer will compare the clicked buttons to the correct answers array 

on click, unclick buttons, click button that was clicked?

when the timer ends or on the finished button click, add the clicked buttons to the guessed answers array

if (correct answer array[0] = guessedanswerarray[0]) {
    correct guess ++

} else if (guessedAnswerArray[0] = null
    unsanswered ++


udefined, or I could have another if statement that says that if there's no answer then it equals a certain variable) {

} else {
incorrect guess ++
    
}
